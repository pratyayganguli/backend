### Redis Guide: (Basic to Advanced Concepts) ###

#### Redis: ####
Redis is an in-memory (key-value) data store primarily used as database. The reason for fast retrieval is because of in-memory storage and not disk based storage.

#### Persistent storage in Redis: ####
Redis does offer persistent storage but in the form of RDB (Redist Database Backup), creates snapshot of data in definte time intervals.
